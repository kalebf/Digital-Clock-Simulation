# Digital-Clock-Simulation

## Description:
This Python project simulates a digital clock using object-oriented programming. The Clock class allows users to input the current time and displays it in either 24-hour or 12-hour AM/PM format. The clock continuously updates every second, mimicking a real-time clock.

## Features:
- User can input the current time (hour, minute, and second).
- Displays the clock in 12-hour format (AM/PM) or 24-hour format.
- Continuously updates the clock every second.
- Handles user input validation to ensure valid time is entered.

## How to Run:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Digital_Clock_Simulation.py
   
## Usage:
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the current hour, minute, and second.
The hour should be between 0 and 23.
The minutes and seconds should be between 0 and 59.
After inputting the time, the clock will start ticking, displaying the updated time every second.
The clock will run for 5 seconds by default (you can modify this behavior in the code).
